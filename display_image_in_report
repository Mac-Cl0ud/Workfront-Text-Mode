# Display an Image in a Report that Links to Project

displayname=Link Project
image.name=Link Project
image.valuefield=URL
link.linkproperty.0.name=projectID
link.linkproperty.0.value=ID
link.lookup=link.edit
link.page=/view
link.valuefield=objCode
link.valueformat=val
textmode=true
type=image
valueformat=

## You must insert the URL for the image into the URL field in the project details, then use the above code
to replace a column in text mode in the view area of the report, then any image linked via the URL in the
project details will show up as a column. Images appear in their actual resolution so try to use small images!
This example is for projects, but applies to any object with a URL in the system details.
